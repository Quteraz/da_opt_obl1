# da_opt_obl1
Obligatory assignmet in optimizing class

In this assignment , different algorithms are going to be tested for solving the traveling salesman 
problem (TSP).
1.  Implement random algorithm, iterative random algorithm and greedy algorithm  in order to 
obtain an initial solution .
2.  Proceed with two optimization algorithms in order to optimize the solutions obtained in  question     
       1. ( greedy optimization, greedy-Random  optimization algorithms )
3.  Compare the algorithms implemented in 1. 
4. Compare the global algorithms ( 1+2) .
5.  Use problems with different sizes: 1000, 5000, 10000.
